# SignalAnalyzer-os-2
Signals analyzer with embedded linux

Development of a signal analyzer that acquires a digital square waveform and computes its period and frequency.
The system has been developed using the  STM32F746DISCO board and  uc-linux embedded as operating system.
To reach the goal, a timer peripheral has been used and a custom linux kernel module has been developed.
